- DELAYED till she had ceased to know,
- Delayed till in its vest of snow
- Her loving bosom lay.{.indent-2}
- An hour behind the fleeting breath,
- Later by just an hour than death,—
- Oh, lagging yesterday!{.indent-2}


- Could she have guessed that it would be;
- Could but a crier of the glee	
- Have climbed the distant hill;{.indent-2}
- Had not the bliss so slow a pace,—
- Who knows but this surrendered face
- Were undefeated still?{:.indent-2}


- Oh, if there may departing be
- Any forgot by victory
- In her imperial round,{.indent-2}
- Show them this meek apparelled thing,
- That could not stop to be a king,
- Doubtful if it be crowned!{.indent-2}
